    "description": "<p><strong>Arnhem Guide</strong> is a React Native app I developed to give users an interactive way to explore Arnhem. The app is backed by Firebase, which serves as the database, handling all the data related to places, opening hours, ratings, and location-based resources like nearby ATMs and public toilets. Firebase’s real-time capabilities allowed me to keep the data dynamically updated without complex backend infrastructure.</p><br> <p>The app features a user-friendly layout to browse locations, view descriptions, check ratings, and find practical info on amenities. For the navigation feature, I integrated Google Maps and Apple Maps redirection, enabling users to get directions to any place listed in the app directly. This integration involved handling various mobile OS-specific functionalities to ensure smooth transitions between the app and mapping services.</p> <br><p>One of the technical highlights is the app's location-based search functionality, which leverages the device’s geolocation to suggest nearby ATMs and public toilets. This feature was challenging but rewarding to build, as it required close attention to performance, battery usage, and permissions management.</p> <br><p>With <strong>Arnhem Guide</strong>, I aimed to combine practical information with a modern mobile experience, providing a resource for both locals and tourists to easily navigate Arnhem’s best spots. The app is currently available in the iOS App Store and serves as a foundation for further enhancements, including potential Android support and real-time recommendation updates.</p>",
