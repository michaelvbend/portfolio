# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my work, skills, and experiences through a minimalistic and modern design. It is built with **Angular** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend. This project served as a learning opportunity to experiment with new Angular features and to appreciate the lightweight nature of Express.js compared to Java Spring Boot.
